## Client On-boarding - Account, Users, Entitlements, Initial Data Upload

Client On-boarding is coordinated through sales and offering managment for both trials and sales.  In order to work thru this process, please reach out to your IBM sales/offering representative. The process results in the following: 

**A.** The product/support team provisions an account (organization/client level) within the Weather Operations Center and generates identities for user(s).

**B.** Creation of user id/passwords for users to access the Weather Operations Center for both application and secure API access.  There are entitlements associated with the keys that tell the platform who the user is (whether administrator or not) - and allow persisting/retrieving data and execution of authorized analytics while maintaining client-specific isolation. 

**C.** For Agriculture add-on clients, the Front-office engagement process also includes a step for on-boarding grower data into the platform at the time of account setup. This is done by creating a client data package that can be uploaded to a secure Box location. Assuming the data package is properly constructed, the product/support team takes care of on-boarding the grower data (at a minimum, field polygons, and optionally, crop type and planting date) within the package against the generated user identities into the Weather Operations Center.
